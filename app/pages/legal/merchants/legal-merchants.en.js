          In a nutshell, we promise to provide you with payment processing services, and you promise to be nice, pay amounts due to us and provide us with information we need. The relationship between us is also totally separate from the relationship you have with your customers to provide goods or services – we’re not involved in the actual supply of any goods and services to your customer and any disputes about those should be resolved directly between you and that customer. We have no involvement in or liability for the contractual arrangements between you and your customers.

            We do not get involved in the actual supply of goods/services, or the provision of support to your customers, all of which is governed by the agreement between you and your customers. It follows that ordinarily, we cannot initiate a refund requested by one of your customers – you must log in to your GoCardless account and process these yourself. An exception to this rule is if we need to stop providing you with services. In any event, you shouldn’t use the refund capability of your account for anything other than a genuine refund to your customers of amounts they’ve already paid to your GoCardless account.

We also allow you to monitor the payments that you receive through GoCardless. We do not provide a service that enables you to accept payment for non-commercial purposes.

              </li>

              <li>
                you shall provide reasonable information and assistance to GoCardless in order to set up the GoCardless Account including the Account Information;

              <li>
                you may sign up as an individual (sole trader) or as a business entity such as a limited company or partnership, in which case any individual who signs up on behalf of the limited company or partnership must be authorised to act on behalf of it;
              </li>

              <li>
                ther than upon termination of this Agreement, GoCardless cannot initiate refunds of payments made to your GoCardless Account on behalf of a Customer, and can only process them when requested to do so by you and, if a Customer cancels its Payment Scheme Mandate or any Payment Order you must seek payment direct from the Customer for any goods or services supplied;

              <li>
                you must not utilise any refund capability of the GoCardless Service for anything other than bona fide refunds requested by or appropriate to a particular Customer in relation to a specific Transaction. For example, you must not refund an amount greater than that paid by any Customer;

                the use of the GoCardless Account and the supply of the GoCardless Service will not create any liability on the part of GoCardless in respect of the supply of goods or services by you to a Customer and you will remain directly liable in relation to such supply;

            Before we can pay out any amounts to you, we must verify your identity (and that of individuals related to the running of any legal business entity), your business and your Nominated Account(s), to our satisfaction (“Verification”). If you initiate any Transactions prior to completion of Verification, this is entirely at your own risk and you acknowledge that those Transactions may be cancelled or reversed if Verification cannot be completed to our satisfaction.
          </li>

                Documentation such as bank statements, financial accounts and statements, and other information relating to the viability, business model and operating history of your business;

              <li>
                We may ask you to transfer to us or receive a small payment so that we can check you have control of the Nominated Account.

          <li>
            In addition, you must inform us which Nominated Account(s) you would like us to settle funds to in respect of Transactions processed under a Payment Scheme. Each Nominated Account must:

            In the event that we cannot complete Verification within a time period determined by and acceptable to us, we may immediately close your GoCardless Account and terminate this Agreement upon notice to you. Upon such termination, we may, at our complete discretion, reverse or cancel or advise your Customers to reverse or cancel any Transactions.

            You acknowledge and authorise us to pass information, and obtain additional information about you and all those related parties for whom you provide information in relation to Verification, to and from certain third parties including identification, credit referencing and monitoring agencies.

        <h3 className='u-color-dark-gray u-margin-Txl u-margin-Bm u-text-s'>Monitoring Programme</h3>

        <div className='simple-terms'>
          <p className='para'>
            We monitor your account, including to check that you don’t have an unacceptable number or volume of chargebacks. If you do have a high number/volume of chargebacks, there are increasingly severe implications, all aimed at helping you reduce your chargebacks while reducing the risk you expose GoCardless to.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            Level 1 kicks in where you have chargebacks totaling between 1% and 3% of total transaction volume or value in any 30 day period. At this level, we’ll contact you via email and give you one month to reduce your chargebacks to less than 1%, and you should keep them at that level for at least 2 months. If you don’t do this, we can terminate our agreement with you.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            Level 2 is similar, but applies where your chargebacks are between 3% and 5%. In addition to the steps we take for Level 1, we’ll also expect to speak to you over the phone, and you will receive money owed to you (less all amounts you owe us) 30 days later than usual.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            Level 3 is our most severe and we hope never to see you in this level. It applies where your chargebacks are between 5% and 7%. The implications are similar to Level 2, although if you don’t reduce your chargeback level to less than 1% within one month, we may terminate your account immediately. In addition, you will receive money owed to you (less all amounts you owe us) 60 days later than usual.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            If your chargebacks go above 7%, we can terminate our agreement with you immediately and stop serving you.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            It’s important to note that if you move from one Level to a higher Level, you still need to bring chargebacks down below 1% within one month of your first entering the Monitoring Programme. This means you can’t drop down Levels until you actually leave the monitoring programme.

            We work within EU data protection rules. In the UK those rules are set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 - other countries in the European Economic Area have equivalent rules based on the same EU standards but the details are not always identical.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            You are the ‘data controller’ for the data related to your customers, and so are responsible for ensuring that your customers’ data is protected legally and technically. GoCardless is a ‘data processor’ and processes personal data according to your instructions in order to provide you with a payment processing service. You have a legal obligation under the UK Act to include data protection clauses in contracts with data processors like us, and these are them!
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            The Information Commissioner (the UK body responsible for data protection enforcement) has published useful guidance detailing the differing responsibilities of controllers and processors that you may find useful: <a href="http://j.mp/cvpguidance">j.mp/cvpguidance</a>. As a controller, one of your key responsibilities is to ensure that you provide appropriate notice of data processing to your Customers – this includes notifying them that their data may be transferred, processed and stored outside of the EEA and may be subject to disclosure as required by applicable law.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            As a data processor, we commit to put in place measures to protect against loss, disclosure, or destruction of your data and also to only use the data to provide you with the services you purchase from us.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            If we send your data outside of the EEA, for example to one of our sub-contractors in the USA, we will always enter into appropriate contracts to protect your data, in accordance with EU law.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            If your customers request their data from us, we’ll send them your way (as you will be the controller of that data), and will assist you in sourcing any information you need to share that we hold.
          </p>

          <p className='para'>
            If you use a third party service with GoCardless, you are responsible for ensuring your data is transferred to them, stored and treated in a way you’re happy with (we’re not responsible for this).

            For the purposes of this Agreement, “Personal Data”, “data controller”, “data processor” and “process” shall have the meaning given by the Data Protection Act 1998.

          <li>
            If either Party to this Agreement processes as a data processor any Personal Data on behalf of the other Party (the other Party being the data controller of that Personal Data) it will:

                process such Personal Data solely in accordance with the other Party’s instructions.

          <li>
            You represent and warrant that you have provided appropriate notice to, and obtained consent from, any Customer whose Personal Data you supply to GoCardless, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. GoCardless is not responsible for any consequences resulting from your failure to provide notice or receive consent from such individuals or for you providing outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate information.
          </li>

          <li>
            You agree that GoCardless may appoint sub-processors to process Personal Data on your behalf, provided that:

                the appointment is in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998; and

              <li>
                such processors are bound by terms that are substantially the same as those set out in this clause.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            If necessary for the purposes of any transfer of personal data outside the EEA, for example to the USA, including to sub-processors, you authorise GoCardless to enter into EU standard contractual clauses in respect of any such transfer.
          </li>

          <li>
            If one of your Customers requests access to their personal data, that we process on your behalf, we will refer that person to you wherever possible, and provide you with reasonable assistance for you to respond to such request or complaint.

          <li>
            You may utilise third party services that connect directly to your GoCardless Account, either by providing them with your account details, via the API or other mechanisms. When you provide your account details to those third parties, you remain liable for all activity under your GoCardless Account, and take full responsibility for ensuring that you have appropriate agreements in place with that third party in relation to transfer of data including personal data.
