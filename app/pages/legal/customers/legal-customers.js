          GoCardless enables suppliers to let their customers pay securely by direct debit over the
          internet. We also allow customers to monitor the payments they make through GoCardless. This
          document sets out the terms between you and GoCardless, and applies to the account that you open
          with GoCardless for these purposes.  These terms and conditions are available on our website and
        you may ask for a copy of them at any time while you have an account with us.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Your contract for goods and services is with a supplier which wants to let you use our payment
          processing services. GoCardless is not involved in the actual supply of any goods and services
          from the supplier. If there is a difficulty with the goods or services the supplier is providing,
          or is going to provide, you must contact the supplier directly.

        <p className='para u-text-heavy'>
          The supplier you are buying from must initiate any refunds relating to their goods and
          services â€“ we cannot, and cancelling a payment with us does not cancel your obligation
          to ensure the supplier is paid for any goods or services that have been provided to you.

          Opening a GoCardless Account
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          When you sign up to GoCardless, you will need to provide us with certain information to create a
          GoCardless account and to set up a direct debit connection to your bank account. We will have to
          perform some identity checks on you before we can initiate a direct debit with you.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          After you have signed up and your GoCardless account is active, we will provide you with a password
          which you will need to access your account and make payments to suppliers who use GoCardless.  When
          you first sign up to GoCardless, it takes 2-4 working days to set up the direct debit mandate.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Your GoCardless 'account' allows you to access information about your past, current and future payment
          transactions linked to your account at the moment. It is not a bank account and there will not be any
          cash held within your GoCardless account at any time as our role relates to the processing of payments.
          Credit, or any other form of overdraft or loan, will also not be available on your GoCardless account.

          Processing payments through GoCardless
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          The time of receipt of your payment order will be when it is received by us.  Where we receive your
          payment order after 4.30pm on a working day, it will be deemed to have been received on the next business
          day. We will then process the payment, by direct debit, for the amount that you have been asked to pay to
          the supplier for the relevant goods and services.  We do not charge you a fee for processing payments through
          GoCardless.  The amount the supplier has told you to pay is the amount which we will take from your bank account.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Once your GoCardless account and direct debit mandate have been set up (as set out under 'Opening a GoCardless
            Account', above), we will transmit each payment order that you make through your GoCardless account to enable
          the settlement of each direct debit to occur on the agreed due date. It usually takes a maximum of 2 working days
          to take money from your bank account.  By providing your email address and password in relation to processing a
          particular payment, you consent to us processing the relevant payment through the GoCardless payment system (which
            can only be cancelled in the circumstances outlined in these terms and conditions under the heading <a href='#cancellation'
            className='u-link-color-p u-text-underline'>Cancellation of a payment transaction</a>).  We may apply spending limits for
          any payment transactions that take place through your GoCardless account.  We will notify you of any spending limits and
          any changes that we make to them.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Any payments that we process are ultimately governed by the terms and conditions issued by your bank relating to your
          relevant bank account.  Like any other payments that you make, other than in the circumstances outlined in these terms
          and conditions you should contact the bank where your account is held if you have any questions relating to your bank
          account and any payments that are made through the GoCardless system.

          Each time we take a payment, an entry for 'gocardless.com' will appear on your bank statement. You can log in to your

          possible, in which case we will inform you at the earliest opportunity and in any event within the time that you would expect any
          payments that are made through GoCardless to be processed. We will not inform you where this would compromise our reasonable
          security measures or is otherwise unlawful. If the reasons for our actions then cease to exist, we will then either reinstate
          your access to your GoCardless account or issue you with new account details as soon as practicable.
