        <p>
          In the UK, we pay out funds 2 working days after theyâ€™re collected from your customer. You
          can collect one-off, regular or variable Direct Debit payments. You can collect payment from
          customers on any day (we do not place any restrictions on collection days). We settle funds on
          a daily basis. For more information,
