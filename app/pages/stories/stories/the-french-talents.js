          Has Bean Coffee</a> is a major supplier of high quality coffee to the retail and wholesale industries.
          In an industry with lead times of up to a year, it is crucial for Has Bean to maintain strong cash flow.</p>

          long overdue invoices." Owner Steve Leighton was left with uncertain cash flow and numerous bad debtors.</p>
