        <p className='para'>
          A subscription allows you to collect regular payments of a fixed amount. There's no need to create the same payment
          week-after-week or month-after-month.

          On the <a href='https://manage.gocardless.com/customers'

          followed by Create &gt; Subscription.

          You'll be shown a screen from where you can personalise the subscription:
        </p>
        <ul className='list'>
          <li>
            The subscription name allows you to identify the payment (e.g. it could be the name of your service or plan).
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose your payment amount (maximum of â‚¬5,000). Once the subscription is set up, the same amount will be collected every time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reference will normally appear on your customer's bank statement (the exact format will depend on your customer's bank).
          </li>
          <li>
            You can choose the frequency over which you collect your payments. For instance: weekly, monthly or yearly. You can also
            define custom intervals (e.g. collecting a payment every 3 months).
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll be able to choose the date of the first payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also choose the duration of the subscription. The subscription could continue until further notice, until a specific
            date or only for a specific number of payments (e.g. after 12 payments are taken).
          </li>
