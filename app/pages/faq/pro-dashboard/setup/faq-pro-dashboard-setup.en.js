          </p>
          <ul className='list'>
            <li>
              Confirm that you've read and accepted our <Link to='legal_merchants'

            </li>
            <li>
              Send us a â‚¬1 payment from your company bank account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Send us a scanned copy of the passport or ID card of your company director.
              You should also provide scanned ID for any investor that owns 25% or more of your company.

            Once these documents have been verified, we'll create a live account for your business (typically in less than 24 hours).
            Once you have the live account, you can use GoCardless to collect Direct Debit payments. There is no need to go via your
            bank to get a SEPA Creditor ID or Bacs SUN.
          </p>
          <p className='para'>
            Please note that anything you do in your test account will not be transferred to your live production account.

          If you wish to migrate existing customers where you already have a Direct Debit mandate in place, please
          email us at <Href to='email' className='u-link-color-p u-text-underline' />.
