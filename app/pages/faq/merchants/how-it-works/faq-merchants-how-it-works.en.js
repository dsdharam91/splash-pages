        <p className='para'>

          Yes - you can either do this by integrating with our <Href to="developer_link" className='u-link-color-p u-text-underline'>API</Href> or by generating a link for a payment
          plan and embedding this as a button on your website.
        </p>

        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          There are certain situations where it may be necessary to place restrictions on your account:
