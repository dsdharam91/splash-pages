            What is SEPA Direct Debit?
          </h3>
          <p className='para'>
            SEPA Direct Debit is a new payment instrument introduced by the European Union in August 2014. It replaces the national
            Direct Debit schemes that operated previously. It allows companies to collect Euro-denominated
            funds from the <a href='https://gocardless.com/guides/sepa/countries/'
            target='_blank' className='u-link-color-p u-text-underline'>Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)</a>.

            What is the Consumer Protection?
          </h3>
          <p className='para'>
            Consumers have the right to be refunded of an authorised SEPA Direct Debit payment. Any refund request must be
            presented to their bank within 8 weeks of their account being debited.
          </p>
          <p className='para'>
            Consumers can also ask for the immediate refund of an unauthorised or fraudulent SEPA Direct Debit payment. They must
            do so as soon as possible and at the latest 13 months after the date their account was debited.
          </p>
          <p className='para'>
            A refund by the bank does not mean that the claim against the underlying bill is justified. It is up to the merchant to
            settle the commercial dispute between the customer and themselves.
          </p>

          <h3 className='u-color-dark-gray u-margin-Txl u-margin-Bm u-text-s'>
            Are there any fees for the customer?
          </h3>
          <p className='para'>
            No. With SEPA, banks are forced not to charge for Direct Debit transactions. It is therefore free for your customers.

            What are the payment timings for Direct Debit?

          <p className='para'>
            Unlike card payments, Direct Debits don't clear instantly. Instead, it takes 3 days to set up
            each new payer, and to collect from payers who you currently have a Direct Debit relationship with.

            Unlike card payments, SEPA Direct Debit transactions don't clear instantly. Instead, you must

            mandate with your customer; and 3 working days afterwards.

          <p className='para'>

          Yes - although Direct Debit is most well-known for recurring payments, it can also be used to
