            We will need some personal details to help us verify your identity and some basic

            How do I test out the product?
          </h3>
          <p className='para'>
            After signing up online, we recommend trying to take a test payment from
            yourself. It takes less than 5 minutes and is completely risk-free.

            If you're a company but you are not registered, you should sign up as an

            Developers should sign up as normal. Once logged in, you can activate your developer account.

          Are there any commitments?

        <p className='para'>
          No. There are no commitments. Signing up just means that you create an account from which you
          can try the product; you can stop using it without paying us anything whatsoever.
