          Where can I find my referral link?
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          Your unique referral code will be displayed in the <a href='https://dashboard.gocardless.com/referrals'
          className='u-link-color-p u-text-underline'>referral section</a> of your GoCardless account. It is accessible
          from your dashboard settings and does not expire.
        </p>

        <h3 className='section-heading u-text-heading-light u-color-dark-gray u-margin-Vm u-text-s'>
          How do I get my credit?
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          We'll collect your fees as usual, and will pay you a rebate every month up to your £50 credit. We will send
          you an email summary at the same time. You can check how much commission you have earned anytime in
          your <a href='https://dashboard.gocardless.com/referrals' className='u-link-color-p u-text-underline'>account settings</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 className='section-heading u-text-heading-light u-color-dark-gray u-margin-Vm u-text-s'>
          Can I send the referral to a different page on the site?
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
           Yes. By default your referral link will go to the GoCardless home page. To send people to a different page,
           take the query string from the end of the referral link and add it to the end of any GoCardless URL.
          </p>
        <p className='para'>
          The query string is the bit that looks like this: '?r=1ABC23DE45'. For example, to send them to the sign-up
          page you would change the URL to: https://gocardless.com/merchants/new?r=1ABC23DE45.

          No - your link will not expire.
        </p>

        <h3 className='section-heading u-text-heading-light u-color-dark-gray u-margin-Vm u-text-s'>
          What if someone I refer forgets to use my link?
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          Just let us know if someone you refer forgets to use your referral link, or the referral is not tracked for
          any reason - we can activate the referral link for you.
