          At GoCardless we are looking to scale from processing <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/1-billion-dollars/' target='_blank'>
          $1 billion a year</a> to over $10 billion. <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/a-new-payment-network-for-the-internet/' target='_blank'>
          Our vision</a> is to create a global payments network, making payments simpler on the internet no matter what country you're in.
          We’re moving into our next phase of growth and are looking to add new talent to the team to continue our momentum
          with SMEs, larger enterprise merchants and our global expansion.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          The need to take recurring payments is increasing: it is becoming strategically important, not only for
          established users of direct debit such as utilities, telecoms, and media companies, but also for the latest
          wave of Software as a Service and Internet of Things providers.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We’re looking for an amazing product marketing manager to take our products and craft the messaging and
          positioning to each of our audiences &ndash; from a small digital agency or a city council looking to modernise
          their existing cumbersome Direct Debit processes, to a global SaaS powerhouse taking payments in 90 countries.
        </p>
        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          Working closely with our Product and Marketing teams you will be responsible for developing our product
          positioning and messaging to differentiate GoCardless from direct competitors and other payment methods in
          each market. You’ll need to be able to adapt these to resonate with the specific needs of our main audiences.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll be the expert on our buyers and potential buyers, understanding their current payment methods, pain points,
          their buying cycle, the key influencers and decision makers, and their criteria. Most importantly you’ll be the
          expert on how to solve these problems and why GoCardless does this better than the competition.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll share your knowledge, sales tools and collateral to support our sales team in their selling process &ndash;
          from creating case studies, landing pages and short feature videos to running webinars. You’ll also share the insight
          you gain from the market, data analysis and product performance with our Product and Engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Collaborating with the wider Marketing and Product teams you’ll be responsible for the launch of new products and features,
          both internally and externally using the most appropriate go-to-market channels.
