          At GoCardless we are looking to scale from processing $1 billion a year to over $10 billion.
          Our <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/a-new-payment-network-for-the-internet/'>vision </a> is to
          create a global payments network, making payments simpler on the internet no matter what country you're in.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We're looking for bright, ambitious people to join our talented sales development team and
          accelerate our growth in the UK market.

        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          The outbound sales development team at GoCardless combines deep product expertise, in depth knowledge
        of the payments industry, and a consultative approach to help generate new opportunities for
          the business. As an outbound SDR, you'll work with business and product leaders across the
          company to uncover and define our best growth opportunities, including new customers, verticals and sales
          strategies. You'll implement outbound campaigns to reach new merchants and be the first point of contact
          before passing qualified opportunities on to our Account Executives.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We do outbound sales a little differently at GoCardless. There will be no cold calling and
          instead a more consultative and targeted approach is taken. The outbound team is focussed on
          developing large enterprise opportunities for GoCardless so a deep understanding of our target
          markets and prospects is essential to succeed. We use a range of tools within the position
          and there are a number of opportunities to attend industry focussed events.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Training for the position will involve a 4 week structured program split across both our inbound
          and outbound SDR teams. The program will give you an in depth overview of the product,
          how we do sales at GoCardless, and a detailed understanding of how we fit into
          the wider payments industry.
