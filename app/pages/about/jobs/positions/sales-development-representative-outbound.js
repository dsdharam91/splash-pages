          There will be no cold calling and instead a more consultative and targeted
          approach is taken. The NBD team is focussed on developing large enterprise
          opportunities for GoCardless so a deep understanding of our target markets
          and prospects is essential to succeed.You'll implement outbound facing
          activites to reach new merchants and be the first point of contact before
          passing qualified opportunities on to our team of Enterprise Account Executives.

        <p className='para'>
          Training for the position will involve a 4 week structured program split
          across both our NBD team as well as our Sales Development team. The program
          will give you an in depth overview of the product, how we reach out to
          enterprise-level merchants, and a detailed understanding of how we fit
          into the wider payments industry.
