          Help protect GoCardless and our customers.

        <p className='para'>
          GoCardless is growing fast. We've built a world-class product that simplifies Direct Debit and opens
          it up to small and medium-sized businesses across the UK and beyond, and we have recently extended our
          offering to multinational companies like the Guardian, TripAdvisor and Box. Thousands of businesses in
          the UK already rely on us to handle their payments, and hundreds more join us every week. About a third
          of these never previously had access to Direct Debit, so we are transforming the way they do business.

        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          Every day you’ll be working as part of a small, close-knit team, to make sure GoCardless is compliant
          with our regulatory requirements. You’ll also help our customers get up and running as seamlessly as possible.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>A typical day will include:</p>
        <ul className='list'>
          <li>
            Reviewing documentation provided by our customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using our sophisticated in-house risk analysis systems to protect our users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Running verification checks on new user accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Responding to emails from our users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Working with our product team to prioritise feature requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll also be involved in improving our internal tools and processes. We believe that technology should make
          us more effective, so we build a lot of our tools in-house and regularly update them. As our product is constantly
          evolving and new features are built, our internal admin dashboard needs regular revisiting. As we learn more about
          our growing customer base we can optimise our risk analysis algorithms.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We care deeply about our customers’ experience and act with their best interests at heart: we take responsibility for their
          problems and we know that there is always something we can do to help, however long it takes.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We've built a friendly, collaborative culture where we hire and develop smart, driven people that share our desire to
          do work we can be proud of. We value learning and feedback, and are devoted to encouraging and supporting each other's
          professional growth.
