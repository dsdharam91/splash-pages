          Find and close new business with our biggest customers and help them
          make recurring payments simple.

        <p className='para'>
          GoCardless is having fun and growing fast. Thousands of businesses in
          the UK already trust us with their payments, and hundreds more are
          joining us every week. We are moving into our next phase of expansion
          and we are looking to add new talent to the team to continue our momentum
          with large enterprise customers.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          The need to take recurring payments is increasing: it is becoming
          strategically important, not only for established users of direct debit
          such as utilities, telecoms, and media companies, but also for the latest
          wave of Software as a Service and Internet of Things providers.

          GoCardless is innovating on top of the BACS network in the UK and
          equivalents around the world. By making these networks easier to integrate
          into modern internet services and adding intelligent, powerful and flexible
          capabilities we are adding value in completely new ways. The ability to
          work with all of these together through a single integration is a real
          game changer. GoCardless will continue to disrupt these systems as payment
          mechanisms continue to evolve.

        <p className='para'>
          Reporting to the VP Sales, you will be responsible for leading and
          driving our UK Enterprise business.  You will manage an existing sales
          team but will also be expected to drive growth personally as we further
          build out the organisation.  Overall success will be achieved by working
          closely with your business partners across the company as well as with
          customers and partners in the market.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You will coach and mentor the existing team helping them develop their
          skills as we grow and through your own actions exemplify a high performing
          enterprise salesperson.  You will do this through structured and informal
          approaches and ultimately will achieve your goals through your own efforts
          and through those whom you manage.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You will coordinate with the Product team to develop new features for
          your market and with the Marketing and Partnership teams to generate a
          healthy pipeline of leads.
