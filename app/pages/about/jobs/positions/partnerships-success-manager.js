          At GoCardless we’re looking to scale from processing $1 billion a year to over $10 billion.
          Our vision is to create a global payments network, making payments simpler on the internet no
          matter what country you're in.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Much of our growth to date has been driven through strategic partnerships which enable customers
          to use GoCardless via leading software platforms such as Xero, Quickbooks and Zuora. Many of our
          customers discover GoCardless through these ‘integration partners’, which also improve our
          proposition by connecting payments to customers’ existing business systems. We also work with
          developer agencies and system integrators to implement our solution, and partner with commercial
          organisations that can introduce or refer us to potential new customers.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          This has enabled us to win tens of thousands of small businesses across a wide range of sectors,
          from gyms and accountants to publishers and SaaS companies. Our partnerships have been key to
          growing our enterprise client base, including household brands such as Thomas Cook, Financial Times,
          TripAdvisor, Box.com and AXA. Partnerships have also been a key route to market when launching in new
          markets such as France, Germany and Spain.
