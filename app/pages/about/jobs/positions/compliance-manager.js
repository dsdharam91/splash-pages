          GoCardless processes more than £1 billion in payments each year. Thousands of businesses across
          the UK and beyond rely on us to handle their payments, and hundreds more sign up every week. As we
          look to the future, those businesses will be larger, more demanding, and present in multiple countries &ndash; and
          so will we. We have a duty to the regulator, our merchants and their customers to treat their funds and their data with the utmost care.

       <ul className='list u-margin-Tm'>

          This role would ideally suit someone with experience in a large compliance team, who is looking to implement a compliance

          unusual backgrounds &ndash; if you’re unsure, please apply. The role will be based in London and we will consider both full time
          and part time applicants.
