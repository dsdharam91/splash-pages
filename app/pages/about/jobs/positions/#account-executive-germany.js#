          Thousands of businesses in the UK already trust us with their payments, and hundreds more are joining us every week. We are moving into our next phase of expansion and we are looking to add new talent to the team to continue our momentum in the German market.

         The need to take recurring payments is increasing: it is becoming strategically important, not only for established users of direct debit such as utilities, telecoms, and media companies, but also for the latest wave of Software as a Service and Internet of Things providers.

        <p className='para'>
          GoCardless is innovating on top of the BACS network in the UK,  the SEPA network across Europe, and equivalents around the world. By making these networks easier to integrate into modern internet services and adding intelligent, powerful and flexible capabilities we are adding value in completely new ways. The ability to work with all of these together through a single integration is a real game changer. GoCardless will continue to disrupt these systems as payment mechanisms continue to evolve.
