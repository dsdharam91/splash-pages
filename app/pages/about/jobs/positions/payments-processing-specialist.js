      GoCardless is growing fast. We’ve built a world-class product that opens up Direct Debit
      to small and medium-sized businesses across the UK and beyond, and we have recently extended
      our offering to multinational companies like the Guardian, TripAdvisor and Box. Thousands of
      businesses in the UK already rely on us to handle their payments, and hundreds more join us
      every week. About a third of these never previously had access to Direct Debit, so we are
      transforming the way they do business.
