          We’re building the next generation of online payments. We already
          provide simple Direct Debit to thousands of small and medium sized
          businesses in the UK and beyond. In the last year, we’ve expanded our
          offering to serve large and multinational companies such as Box, TripAdvisor,
          and the UK Government, and we’ve begun our expansion across Europe.

          We’re looking for an adaptable, pragmatic lawyer to help us on our path
          to create a global payment network for the internet.

        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          You will be responsible for the day-to-day legal operations of our business
          as we work towards global expansion. You’ll take a constructive, realistic
          approach to practical problems: your goal is to facilitate faster action,
          though not at the expense of prudence.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll support our sales team on negotiating and maintaining commercial
          contracts, both in the UK and internationally. You will streamline and
          optimise processes to keep our sales pipeline running smoothly while
          ensuring that our contracts are fit for purpose.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Working alongside our finance team, you’ll address legal requirements
          for financing rounds, and resolve tax issues around our expansion. You’ll
          collaborate with our operations team to develop our regulatory strategy
          in line with our global expansion.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll anticipate and address any legal issues arising from our international
          expansion, from privacy and data protection to setting up subsidiaries
          and ensuring we comply with local employment laws. You will be responsible
          for engaging external counsel in new countries and ensuring that any
          legal work conducted on our behalf meets our requirements, provides value
          and doesn’t inhibit our growth velocity.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          As first port of call for any legal queries across the company, you’ll
          be friendly, approachable and able to unravel and clearly communicate
          legal complexities. Knowledgeable and shrewd, you’ll know where you can
          add value &ndash; and where your involvement will unnecessarily impede our
          progress &ndash; and you’ll seek to implement straightforward, light-touch
          processes throughout.
