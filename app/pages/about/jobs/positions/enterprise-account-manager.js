          GoCardless is having fun and growing fast. Thousands of businesses
          in the UK already trust us with their payments, and hundreds more are
          joining us every week. We are moving into our next phase of expansion
          and we are looking to add new talent to the team to continue our
          momentum with large enterprise customers.

          The need to take recurring payments is increasing: it is becoming
          strategically important, not only for established users of direct
          debit such as utilities, telecoms, and media companies, but also for
          the latest wave of Software as a Service and Internet of Things
          providers.

          GoCardless is innovating on top of the BACS network in the UK and
          equivalents around the world. By making these networks easier to
          integrate into modern internet services and adding intelligent,
          powerful and flexible capabilities we are adding value in completely
          new ways. The ability to work with all of these together through a
          single integration is a real game changer. GoCardless will continue
          to disrupt these systems as payment mechanisms continue to evolve.
