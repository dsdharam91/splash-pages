          Help us to expand GoCardless to countries around the world.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We've built a world-class payments product that makes it really easy
          for businesses to accept recurring payments. We work with a wide variety
          of businesses from sole traders to multinational corporations like
          TripAdvisor, The Guardian and Box.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We've gained great traction in the UK, quickly expanding in Europe,
          and now we want to make recurring payments simpler even further afield.
          The opportunity is there, but we need to move fast to become a global
          success. We're looking for results-oriented, adaptable self-starters
          to lead this expansion.
        </p>
        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          You will be responsible for helping to prioritise which countries
          GoCardless enters next. You will plan &amp; execute the setup in each
          country &ndash; juggling a number of geographies at a time. After
          operationally setting this up, you'll hand over to a Country Lead
          who will launch commercially. Recent examples include Sweden, Australia
          and the USA.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll be responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul className='list'>
          <li>
            Market research and analysis of new geographies
          </li>
          <li>
            Working with other senior staff to prioritise new country expansion
          </li>
          <li>
            Negotiating banking partnerships and securing regulatory approval
          </li>
          <li>
            Managing relationships with banks, regulators and suppliers
          </li>
          <li>
            Assisting with recruitment and training of junior staff as we launch
            across new geographies
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommending sales and marketing strategies and targets for new
            geographies
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='para'>
          This role will be varied: you need to be comfortable digging into the
          details of country-specific payment regulation one day and leading tough
          banking negotiations the next. You'll need to be confident making
          recommendations and pulling in experts from inside the business as well
          as sourcing external help. You'll have the freedom &amp; responsibility
          to determine your own goals and how best to achieve these.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>

          and supporting each other's continual professional growth.
