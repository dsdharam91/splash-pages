          At GoCardless we are looking to
          <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/1-billion-dollars/' target='_blank'> scale from processing $1 billion a year to $10 billion</a>.
          Our <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/a-new-payment-network-for-the-internet/' target='_blank'> vision </a>
          is to create a global payments network, making payments simpler on
          the internet no matter what country you're in. We started out doing
          this for SMEs in the UK, but we’ve recently started serving large
          organisations like The Guardian, TripAdvisor and the UK Government
          as well as expanding into Europe and beyond. We believe that this is
          only the start of our journey.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We're looking for bright, ambitious people to join our talented sales
          team and accelerate our growth in the UK market.

        /*eslint-enable max-len*/
        <p className='para'>
          On a typical day you will be:
        </p>
        <ul className='list u-margin-Tm'>
          <li>
            Speaking to potential customers and advising them on how to use our product.
          </li>
          <li>
            Giving product demonstrations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finding improvements in our current sales processes and putting them into practice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='para'>
          After 3-6 months, you will start closing deals. You will also become
          a mentor for new members of the team, coaching them on how we do sales.

        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The ideal candidate</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          We’ve identified the following 5 characteristics as being most important
          for successful sales people here:
        </p>
        <ul className='list u-margin-Tm'>
          <li>
            Smart. Our product is technical. To succeed here you need to be
            able to understand how complex systems work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Driven to learn and improve. We believe how good you’ll be a year
            from now is more dependent on attitude than current ability. How
            driven you are and how motivated you are to improve are the two
            most important drivers of success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Coachable. Giving and taking feedback is one of the most important
            aspects of our company culture. The quicker you are able to act on
            feedback, the faster you learn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Likeable. People don’t like to buy from people they don’t like. It
            is essential that anyone we employ is easy to get along with.
          </li>
          <li>
            An excellent communicator. The ability to explain complex ideas
            simply is absolutely crucial for our salespeople.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='para'>
          This role particularly suits either exceptional graduates or people
