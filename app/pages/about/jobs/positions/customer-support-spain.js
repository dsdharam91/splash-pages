          GoCardless is growing fast. We’ve built a world-class product that makes it simple
          for small and medium businesses to take recurring payments, and allows startups
          and large corporations to automate their payments in a way that was never possible before.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          After launching in the UK and entering the Spanish market in late 2015 &ndash; we are rapidly
          gaining traction in Spain, serving hundreds of companies such as elTenedor, Tripadvisor and ImpactHub.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We’re looking for a bright, enthusiastic problem-solver to join our team, provide legendary
          customer service and support our growth in Spain.
        </p>
        <h4 className='u-text-xs u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          Every day you’ll be listening to our customers, answering their
          questions and reassuring them that their payments are in safe hands,
          so that they can focus on what matters most: their business.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We’ll help you become an expert in the complexity of our product and
          learn the multiple ways it can be used. You’ll tailor your approach
          and the level of information you give depending on what the
          individual user needs to know. You’ll be empowered to actually
          address their concerns and be responsible for following through
          until they are satisfied. You will join our friendly, tight-knit
          team and work together to find creative solutions to even the
          toughest problems. Ultimately we want every customer to hang up
          happy.

        <p className='para'>
          A typical day will include:
        </p>
        <ul className='list u-margin-Tm'>
          <li>
            Answering calls and emails from our UK and Spain-based customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using our sophisticated in-house fraud detection systems to protect
            our users.
          </li>
          <li>

        </ul>
        <p className='para'>
          You’ll also be involved in improving our internal support tools and
          processes. We believe that technology should make us more effective,
          so a lot of our tools are built in-house and regularly updated. As
          our product is constantly evolving and new features are built, our
          internal admin dashboard needs regular revisiting. As we learn more
          about our growing customer base we can optimise our fraud detection
          algorithms. We create new processes to help us get more done, such
          as new email templates for common queries.

        <p className='para'>
          We care deeply about our customers’ experience and act with their
          best interest at heart: we take responsibility for their problems
          and we know that there is always something we can do to help, however
          long it takes. You’ll know our customers best, and have valuable input
          for everyone across the company - from working with the engineering
          team to get bugs fixed, to helping our sales team understand what
          our current users love.
