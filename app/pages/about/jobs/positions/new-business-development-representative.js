        <p className='para'>
          At GoCardless we are looking to scale from processing $1 billion a year to over $10 billion.
          Our <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/a-new-payment-network-for-the-internet/'>vision </a> is to
          create a global payments network, making payments simpler on the internet no matter what country you're in.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We're looking for bright, ambitious people to join our talented New Business Development team and
          accelerate our growth in the UK market.

        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>The role</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          The New Business Development team at GoCardless sits within our Sales function and combines deep product expertise, in depth knowledge
          of the payments industry, and a consultative approach to help generate new opportunities for
          the business. As an NBD rep, you'll work with business and product leaders across the
          company to uncover and define our best growth opportunities, including new customers, verticals and sales
          strategies. You'll implement outbound campaigns to reach new merchants and be the first point of contact
          before passing qualified opportunities on to our Account Executives.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We generate new opportunities a little differently at GoCardless. There will be no cold calling and instead a more
          consultative and targeted approach is taken. The NBD team is focussed on developing large enterprise opportunities
          for GoCardless so a deep understanding of our target markets and prospects is essential to succeed. We use a range
          of tools within the position and there are a number of opportunities to attend industry focussed events.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Training for the position will involve a four week structured program split across our NBD team and
          Sales Development team. The program will give you an in depth overview of the product, how we do sales at
          GoCardless, and a detailed understanding of how we fit into the wider payments industry.
