          The role
        </h4>
        <p className='para'>
          We've laid strong foundations in the UK, and these will
          guide you as you figure out a strategy that will deliver rapid growth
          in Germany and Austria. Then you'll execute this strategy, driving in-country
          work independently and resourcefully, and swiftly becoming an expert in your
          market.

          You have been taught that one part of being an entrepreneur is to be a salesperson?
          In this role, you will put this into practice. All client-facing activities in your
          market will be your responsibility: planning and delivering on launch activities to
          build momentum early and accompanying prospective customers from sales to live.
          You'll handle initial marketing, PR, sales, partnerships and account management,
          and start to build a team to support &amp; scale growth in your market.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You will work closely with leaders across the company to understand all product,
          engineering and operational requirements, so you'll need to be adept at
          discussing complex situations with a wide variety of audiences. You'll
          feed your market's needs into our development roadmap to ensure we're always
          building the product people want.

          Launching GoCardless in a new territory will require a depth and breadth of
          skills akin to starting a new company. It's an exciting challenge, and you'll
          benefit from the support and experience of our existing country leads.
          In fact, we believe that launching GoCardless in a new territory as important
          as Germany and Austria requires two of your kind, to keep you on your toes and offer
          an opportunity to discuss ideas and strategies, but also to challenge each other.
