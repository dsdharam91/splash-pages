          At GoCardless we’re looking to scale from processing $1 billion a year
          to over $10 billion. Our vision is to create a global payments network,
          making payments simpler on the internet no matter what country you're in.
        </p>

        <p className='para'>
          Much of our growth to date has been driven through strategic partnerships
          which enable customers to use GoCardless via leading software platforms
          such as Xero, Quickbooks and Zuora. Many of our customers discover
          GoCardless through these ‘integration partners’, which also improve our
          proposition by connecting payments to customers’ existing business systems.
          We also work with developer agencies and system integrators to implement
          our solution, and partner with commercial organisations that can introduce
          or refer us to potential new customers.
        </p>

        <p className='para'>
          This has enabled us to win tens of thousands of small businesses across
          a wide range of sectors, from gyms and accountants to publishers and
          SaaS companies. Our partnerships have also been key to growing our
          enterprise client base, including household brands such as Thomas Cook,
          Financial Times, TripAdvisor, Box.com and Axa. Partnerships have also
          been a key route to market when launching in new markets such as France,
          Germany and Spain.

        <p className='para'>
