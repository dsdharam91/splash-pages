          We're looking for an amazing designer to build the brand and visual identity for GoCardless.
        </p>
        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>Our work</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          Over the past few years, GoCardless' products have allowed small companies to take subscriptions
        for the first time &ndash; fundamentally changing the way they do business. But we're not done yet. We've
          just scratched the surface for small companies, and we want to do the same thing for the biggest
          organisations on the planet.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We’re launching a whole new version of our product, and need to be able to tell the world about it!
          We need to define the way we communicate online and offline, the way our brand looks
          and feels, and what we do to express that.
        </p>
        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>Our culture</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          With a small, talented team and an amazing new office in central London, we feel like we're in
          a great position to tackle these challenges. New designers will play a key role in shaping our team
          and culture, as well as the direction of our brand. You’ll work closely with the design team,
          as well as the marketing team, our VP’s of Marketing and Sales, and the founders of the business.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Despite the scale of our work, we're small and friendly, with strong shared values. We get on well
          and enjoy spending time together, whether working in the office, chatting over lunch, or out for drinks
          after work. We're passionate about learning, and we all care deeply about the quality of what we make.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We’re creating a strong design culture at GoCardless, and we'll support you by paying for training,
          events, and sending you to conferences around the world (if that's what you're into).
        </p>
        <h4 className='u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm'>What we're looking for</h4>
        <p className='para'>
          We're looking for someone with a couple of years experience developing visual identities and marketing

          all that matters is the quality of your work.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          Day to day you will be creating assets and materials, meaning you’ll see a ton of your work out in
          the world; you’ll also be in charge of our brand identity, and developing it for the long term.
